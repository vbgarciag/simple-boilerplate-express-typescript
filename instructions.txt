1. Create a Node JS Express server
2. Create user endpoints to perform the following actions:
  - GET ALL: return a list of all users
  - GET BY ID: return a user object or null
  - CREATE: create a new user
  - UPDATE: update user data of an existing user
  - REMOVE: remove an existing user from the user data
  - You should use the UserRepository placed in `./data-access/inMemory/repositories/UserRepository` which contains all methods needed
3. Validate the request input for each endpoint to ensure all data incoming is the correct
4. Add a new function to the UserRepository that creates a new user if it doesn't exist or returns it if it does exist
